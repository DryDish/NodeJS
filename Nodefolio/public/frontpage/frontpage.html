  <h1 class="presentation-text">About me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a computer science student at Kea who loves creating new things and
    learning new technologies every day.I thoroughly enjoy the constant search
    for new and better solutions that occurs during the software development
    process and hope to be able to pursue this path even further.<br /><br />Although
    new to the field, I've pushed myself and worked as a developer in a startup
    alongside my studies, further expanding my knowledge and progressing my
    passion. As a developer, I'm quite flexible and can easily adapt to new
    tasks, like a chameleon adapts to its environment.
